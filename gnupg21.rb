    Once you run the new gpg2 binary you will find it incredibly
    difficult to go back to using `gnupg2` from Homebrew/Homebrew.
    The new 2.1.x moves to a new keychain format that can't be
    and won't be understood by the 2.0.x branch or lower.

    If you use this `gnupg21` formula for a while and decide
    you don't like it, you will lose the keys you've imported since.
    For this reason, we strongly advise that you make a backup
    of your `~/.gnupg` directory.

    For full details of the changes, please visit:
      https://www.gnupg.org/faq/whats-new-in-2.1.html

    If you are upgrading to gnupg21 from gnupg2 you should execute:
      `killall gpg-agent && gpg-agent --daemon`
    After install. See:
      https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions/issues/681
